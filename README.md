pharmacist system Management

This website is designed using Html, css, JavaScript and bootstrap and connected to phpmyadmin using php language. The idea of this project
is to allow the pharmacists to enter their available medicines on the system in order to be tracked on google maps by the patients. 
I have provided the patients mobile version that allows them to search for their medicines and the application will return all the needed
information( medicine name, pharmacy name, location, phone number, etc...) using Flutter framework.

The project contains two dashboards one for admins and one for pharmacists. The admins can manage pharmacists and view statistics, and the second
for pharmacists and allow them to enter the medicine name and the quantity knowing that the quantity will be private, only the pharmacist can 
access the quantity. If the quantity is zero it will be automatically hidden and will not appear with the search results on the mobile version.

You can simply visit the website, I hosted it on 000Webhost. Click on (https://hussien300.000webhostapp.com/PSM/).
